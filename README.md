# VBA-Assignment

# Background

In this activity, I utilized VBA to manipulate and elucidate data from a spreadsheet of real-world stock data from 2014-2016. The workbook which was used was titled Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx, and its size prevents it from being accessed directly on GitHub. Test data (alphebetical_testing.xlsx) was used to develop the scripts.

Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019 provided the Excel application which was utilized in Visual Basic Coding. Additionally, I used a PC with Windows 10.

# What did I do with the data?

The code is held in the file VBA_Stock_Calculations.bas in this repository
